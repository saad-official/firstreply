-- agent_events is an append-only audit trail (hand-written migration).
-- UPDATE is always rejected. DELETE is rejected unless the parent organization
-- is already gone, i.e. the delete is the ON DELETE CASCADE from deleting the
-- whole organization (account deletion). TRUNCATE is always rejected.
-- This applies to every role, including the table owner.
